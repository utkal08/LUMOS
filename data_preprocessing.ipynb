      "An AVL tree defined as a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference between heights of left and right subtrees for any node cannot be more than one.\n",
      "The difference between the heights of the left subtree and the right subtree for any node is known as the balance factor of the node.\n",
      "The AVL tree is named after its inventors, Georgy Adelson-Velsky and Evgenii Landis, who published it in their 1962 paper “An algorithm for the organization of information”.\n",
      "Example of AVL Trees:\n",
      "AVL tree\n",
      "The above tree is AVL because the differences between the heights of left and right subtrees for every node are less than or equal to 1.\n",
      "Operations on an AVL Tree:\n",
      "Insertion\n",
      "Deletion\n",
      "Searching [It is similar to performing a search in BST]\n",
      "Rotating the subtrees in an AVL Tree:\n",
      "An AVL tree may rotate in one of the following four ways to keep itself balanced:\n",
      "Left Rotation:\n",
      "When a node is added into the right subtree of the right subtree, if the tree gets out of balance, we do a single left rotation.\n",
      "Left-Rotation in AVL tree\n",
      "Right Rotation:\n",
      "If a node is added to the left subtree of the left subtree, the AVL tree may get out of balance, we do a single right rotation.\n",

      "Right-Left Rotation in AVL tree\n",
      "Applications of AVL Tree:\n",
      "It is used to index huge records in a database and also to efficiently search in that.\n",
      "For all types of in-memory collections, including sets and dictionaries, AVL Trees are used.\n",
      "Database applications, where insertions and deletions are less common but frequent data lookups are necessary\n",
      "Software that needs optimized search.\n",
      "It is applied in corporate areas and storyline games.\n",
      "Advantages of AVL Tree:\n",
      "AVL trees can self-balance themselves.\n",
      "It is surely not skewed.\n",
      "It provides faster lookups than Red-Black Trees\n",
      "Better searching time complexity compared to other trees like binary tree.\n",
      "Height cannot exceed log(N), where, N is the total number of nodes in the tree.\n",
      "Disadvantages of AVL Tree:\n",
      "It is difficult to implement.\n",
      "It has high constant factors for some of the operations.\n",
      "Less used compared to Red-Black trees.\n",
      "Due to its rather strict balance, AVL trees provide complicated insertion and removal operations as more rotations are performed.\n",
      "Take more processing for balancing.\n",

      "Let us consider the following problem to understand Binary Indexed Tree.\n",
      "We have an array arr[0 . . . n-1]. We would like to \n",
      "1 Compute the sum of the first i elements. \n",
      "2 Modify the value of a specified element of the array arr[i] = x where 0 <= i <= n-1.\n",
      "A simple solution is to run a loop from 0 to i-1 and calculate the sum of the elements. To update a value, simply do arr[i] = x. The first operation takes O(n) time and the second operation takes O(1) time. Another simple solution is to create an extra array and store the sum of the first i-th elements at the i-th index in this new array. The sum of a given range can now be calculated in O(1) time, but the update operation takes O(n) time now. This works well if there are a large number of query operations but a very few number of update operations.\n",
      "Could we perform both the query and update operations in O(log n) time? \n",
      "One efficient solution is to use Segment Tree that performs both operations in O(Logn) time.\n",
      "An alternative solution is Binary Indexed Tree, which also achieves O(Logn) time complexity for both operations. Compared with Segment Tree, Binary Indexed Tree requires less space and is easier to implement..\n",
      "Representation \n",
      "Binary Indexed Tree is represented as an array. Let the array be BITree[]. Each node of the Binary Indexed Tree stores the sum of some elements of the input array. The size of the Binary Indexed Tree is equal to the size of the input array, denoted as n. In the code below, we use a size of n+1 for ease of implementation.\n",
      "Construction \n",
      "We initialize all the values in BITree[] as 0. Then we call update() for all the indexes, the update() operation is discussed below.\n",
      "Operations \n",
      "  getSum(x): Returns the sum of the sub-array arr[0,…,x] \n",
      "// Returns the sum of the sub-array arr[0,…,x] using BITree[0..n], which is constructed from arr[0..n-1] \n",
      "1) Initialize the output sum as 0, the current index as x+1. \n",
      "2) Do following while the current index is greater than 0. \n",
      "…a) Add BITree[index] to sum \n",
      "…b) Go to the parent of BITree[index]. The parent can be obtained by removing \n",
      "the last set bit from the current index, i.e., index = index – (index & (-index)) \n",
      "3) Return sum.\n",
      "  The diagram above provides an example of how getSum() is working. Here are some important observations.\n",
      "BITree[0] is a dummy node. \n",
      "BITree[y] is the parent of BITree[x], if and only if y can be obtained by removing the last set bit from the binary representation of x, that is y = x – (x & (-x)).\n",
      "The child node BITree[x] of the node BITree[y] stores the sum of the elements between y(inclusive) and x(exclusive): arr[y,…,x). \n",
      "  update(x, val): Updates the Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) by performing arr[index] += val \n",
      "// Note that the update(x, val) operation will not change arr[]. It only makes changes to BITree[] \n",
      "1) Initialize the current index as x+1. \n",
      "2) Do the following while the current index is smaller than or equal to n. \n",
      "…a) Add the val to BITree[index] \n",
      "…b) Go to next element of BITree[index]. The next element can be obtained by incrementing the last set bit of the current index, i.e., index = index + (index & (-index))\n",
      "  The update function needs to make sure that all the BITree nodes which contain arr[i] within their ranges being updated. We loop over such nodes in the BITree by repeatedly adding the decimal number corresponding to the last set bit of the current index.\n",
      "How does Binary Indexed Tree work? \n",
      "The idea is based on the fact that all positive integers can be represented as the sum of powers of 2. For example 19 can be represented as 16 + 2 + 1. Every node of the BITree stores the sum of n elements where n is a power of 2. For example, in the first diagram above (the diagram for getSum()), the sum of the first 12 elements can be obtained by the sum of the last 4 elements (from 9 to 12) plus the sum of 8 elements (from 1 to 8). The number of set bits in the binary representation of a number n is O(Logn). Therefore, we traverse at-most O(Logn) nodes in both getSum() and update() operations. The time complexity of the construction is O(nLogn) as it calls update() for all n elements. \n",
