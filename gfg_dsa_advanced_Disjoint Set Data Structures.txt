A disjoint-set data structure is defined as one that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:
Find: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can determine if two elements are in the same subset.
Union: Join two subsets into a single subset. Here first we have to check if the two subsets belong to the same set. If not, then we cannot perform union.
